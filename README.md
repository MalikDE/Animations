## 1. Circle to Rect transition

This transition is inspired by this [materialup animation][circle-to-rect-anim-link]. 

This is a shared content transition between 2 activities. The first activity has a circular view (like a FloatingActionButton)that will be morphed into a rectangular header view. 
The custom transition inherit from the[ChangeBounds][changebounds-link]android transition.
